        <h1 class="text-white">My Story</h1>
        <hr class="color-yellow">
        <p class="text-white"> I began programming on and off sometime in early 2020, ever since then, 
             I've always had a passion for writing software. Around a year and a half after high school I enrolled 
            in the Winter 2022 semester of the 
            <a href="https://www.algonquincollege.com/sat/program/computer-engineering-technology-computing-science/#courses4">Computer Engineering Technology Program</a> 
            at <a>Algonquin College</a>. It was there where I learned a variety of both practical programming classes and computer science theory. Fortunately I also was able to gain real world software development experience through my internship placement
            at <a href="https://www.curtisswright.com/">Curtiss-Wright</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="text-white">Writing software is interesting to me becuase I truly enjoy the craft of building a system from scratch, I like that no matter
            what I write I feel as though it can always be improved, like there's always something new to learn. An interest in learning is one of the main
            reasons I chose this carrer path in the first place, I've always really enjoyed learning new things.
